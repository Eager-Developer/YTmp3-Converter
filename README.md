# YTmp3-Converter
## Quick presentation
Easy way to convert your favorite YouTube songs to MP3!
Works well, fast, conveniently and selects the best quality for you.
Simply put one YouTube URL per line in a text file, then run the YTmp3.bat file, and the program will do the rest for you!
The Utility folder will keep track of the URL files you already downloaded and of the errors that might occur through the web request process.
Note: This program is using the yt-dlp module, so the web requests are not directly handled by myself. I just created this program to automate the downloading process.

## Upcoming features
Right now, because of the way the URL containing file is managed, it is not possible to continue pasting in links, while the program is already running. An update will aim to fix that in the near future.
There might be some bugs, or at least some features that don't work 100% at the moment; the project still needs a bit of work.
