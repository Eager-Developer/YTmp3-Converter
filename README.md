# YTmp3-Converter
## Quick presentation
Easy way to convert your favorite YouTube songs to MP3!
Works well, fast, conveniently and select the best quality for you.
Simply put one YouTube URL per line in a text file, and then run the YTmp3.bat file.
The program will do the rest for you!
The Utility file will keep track of your the URL files you already downloaded and of the errors that might occur through the web request process.
Note: This program is using the yt-dlp module, so the web requests are not directly handled by myself. I just created this program to automate the downloading process.

## Upcoming features
Right now, because of the way the URL containing file is managed, this is not possible to continue pasting links to it while the program is already running. An update will aim to fix that in the near future.
Their might be some bugs, or at least some functionnalities that are not 100% working as of right now, but the project still needs a bit of work.
